call stack is stack : a memory or a section of memory in a computer 
for temporary storage in which the last item stored is the first retrieved

suppose we have a nested function 'one()', and inside 'two()' and inside 'three()'

so, in the stack memory first one() will be push then two() and then three()
and we know that in the stack memory Last in First out(LIFO) process happens. 
so, three() would be poped out first then two() and then one()
